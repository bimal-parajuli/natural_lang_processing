The sun is about to set and the bull is running on the ground. 
The bull is very angry and some children are running on the ground. 
Another bull is eating grass while it is walking on the ground. 
The children are playing football happily and enjoying. 
Football is rolling on the ground while James is watching He is walking on the footpath next to the ground. 
There are some people roaming in the ground while discussing about Natural language Processing and its impact on humanity. 
There is a huge bus on the ground just behind this ground and it is also approaching towards the ground. 
I hope the bus doesnâ€™t come to this ground because the children are playing on this ground.

He is walking on the ground.
The bull is rolling on the ground.
